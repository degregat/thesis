  Except where otherwise indicated, this thesis is my own original
  work. The chapter on compliance aware bandits contains material that has been coauthored with David Balduzzi and Mark D. Reid, and appears in a paper. The work on bandits with hindsights has benefitted from discussions with David Lopez Paz, David Balduzzi and Dario Garcia Garcia, and contains elements from a manuscript in progress. The work on decision elicitation from multiple experts has benefited from conversations with David Balduzzi and Mark D. Reid.
