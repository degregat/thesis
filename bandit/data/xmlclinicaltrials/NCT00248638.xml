    <textblock>
      Relative glutamine (GLN) deficiency may contribute to morbidity and mortality in surgical
      intensive care unit (SICU) patients. During critical illness, GLN utilization by the immune
      system, gut mucosa and other tissues exceeds endogenous production and plasma GLN
      concentrations decrease, which may contribute to cellular dysfunction and increase
      nosocomial infection risk and mortality. Conventional GLN-free parenteral nutrition (PN) has
      a limited impact on SICU outcomes and does not repair the GLN deficit. Our recent pilot data
      show that GLN dipeptide-supplemented PN decreases nosocomial infections and improves
      clinical outcomes in SICU patients. The process of benefit is poorly understood, but animal
      and human data suggest that GLN treatment correlates with a) up-regulation of cytoprotective
      molecules in blood and tissues [e.g, GSH, specific heat shock proteins (HSPs) and GLN]; and
      b) improved epithelial barrier defenses and immune cell number and function. Properties of
      L-GLN limit provision in solution, but the GLN dipeptide alanyl-GLN (AG) confers stability
      and solubility in PN (AG-PN). We propose a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled
      phase III trial based on our pilot data to test the hypothesis that AG-PN improves clinical
      outcomes in SICU patients requiring PN after cardiac, vascular or colonic operations.
      Subjects will receive either standard GLN-free PN or isocaloric, isonitrogenous, AG-PN until
      enteral feeds are established. Specific Aim 1 is to determine whether AG-PN decreases
      hospital mortality, nosocomial infection and other important indices of morbidity. Specific
      Aim 2 is to obtain novel, mechanistically relevant observational data in the Aim 1 subjects
      on whether AG-PN a) increases serial blood levels of GSH, HSP-70 and -27, and GLN; b)
      decreases the presence in serum of the bacterial products flagellin and LPS and the adaptive
      immune response to these mediators; and c) improves key indices of innate/adaptive immunity.
      This study is designed to delineate the clinical benefit of a major new nutrition support
      strategy in high-risk SICU patients.

      Overview: Relative deficiency of glutamine (GLN) appears to contribute to morbidity and
      mortality in surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients, but conventional nutrition
      support does not repair this deficit. GLN requirements increase during critical illness when
      utilization by the immune system, gut mucosa and other tissues exceeds endogenous
      production. GLN depletion under these conditions may contribute to hospital morbidity and
      mortality. Conventional parenteral nutrition (PN) does not contain GLN and thus does not
      prevent GLN depletion in catabolic patients. However, our pilot study and other reports
      strongly suggest that GLN-supplemented PN improves metabolic and clinical outcomes in
      critically ill patients. Underlying mechanisms for GLN action are poorly understood, but may
      involve systemic upregulation of the cytoprotective molecules glutathione (GSH), specific
      heat shock proteins (HSP) and GLN itself, improved gut barrier defenses, and improved innate
      and/or adaptive immune function. Properties of L-GLN limit provision in PN, but the
      dipeptide alanyl-glutamine (AG) confers stability and solubility in PN solutions. The P.I.'s
      pilot study demonstrated a marked decrease in nosocomial infection, improved indices of
      organ function, and a possible decrease in hospital mortality in SICU patients receiving
      AG-supplemented PN (AG-PN) versus standard, GLN-free PN (STD-PN). We propose a multi-center,
      double-blind, controlled, Phase III trial, based on a pilot study, that will determine the
      effect of parenteral GLN on important clinical outcomes in patients requiring SICU care and
      PN after cardiac, vascular or colonic surgery. We also propose to obtain needed
      hypothesis-generating, descriptive data from the Aim 1 study subjects to inform subsequent,
      truly mechanistic studies of GLN action in animal and human models of surgical critical
      illness. Study subjects will be randomized on an intent-to-treat basis to receive AG-PN or
      isonitrogenous, isocaloric STD-PN until enteral feeding is established.

      Hypotheses:

        1. SICU patients receiving PN supplemented with GLN dipeptide (AG-PN) will demonstrate
           improved clinical outcomes compared to patients receiving STD-PN.

        2. Administration of AG-PN in the Aim 1 study subjects: a) increases serial blood levels
           of specific cytoprotective molecules and improves systemic redox status; b) is
           associated with decreased serum positivity for the bacterial products flagellin and
           lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) and the adaptive immune response to these mediators; and c)
           improves key indices of innate/adaptive immunity.

      Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: To perform a Phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether AG-PN
      decreases hospital mortality, nosocomial infections, and other indices of hospital morbidity
      versus STD-PN in SICU patients. The study will test whether AG-PN: decreases hospital
      mortality and the incidence of nosocomial infection (primary endpoints) in SICU patients
      after cardiac, vascular or colonic surgery. We will also determine whether AG-PN decreases
      total hospital infections, bloodstream infections (BSI), infections due to Staphylococcus
      aureus or fungal species, the number of days patients require mechanical ventilation, the
      SICU and total hospital length of stay and the 6-month mortality rate (secondary endpoints).

      Aim 2: To determine in the Aim 1 study subjects whether AG-PN: a) increases systemic blood
      concentrations of the cytoprotective molecules GSH, HSP-70, HSP-27 and GLN and improves
      systemic GSH and cysteine redox status; b) is associated with decreased serum positivity for
      the bacterial products flagellin and LPS and titers of anti-flagellin and anti-LPS
      immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG); and c) improves
      key indices of innate/adaptive immune cell function.

            <description>Glutamine dipeptide supplemented nutrition to be given to participants.
Glutamine dipeptide: Subjects randomized to AG-PN will receive PN containing 0.5 g/kg/day of L alanyl L GLN (AG) dipeptide (Dipeptiven 20%; Fresenius-Kabi) and 1.0 g/kg/day of 15% Clinisol (Baxter Inc., Deerfield, IL) AA solution (total = 1.5 g/kg/day, with AG replacing 1/3 of Clinisol AA). Subjects randomized to STD-PN will receive PN AA as the standard, GLN-free amino acid solution (15% Clinisol). The AA solutions are nearly isonitrogenous; STD-PN provides 2.35 g nitrogen and the AG-PN provides 2.45 g nitrogen per 100 ml 15% AA solution. The amount of GLN dipeptide administered each day will be determined by daily PN volume intake data.
Study subjects will receive a maximum of 28 days of study PN (blinded placebo or GLN-dipeptide-supplemented PN). If the subject continues to require PN after Day 28, study PN and GLN dipeptide will be discontinued.</description>
