  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Awareness during anesthesia is a problem receiving increased attention by patients,
      clinicians, and the general public. The incidence of intraoperative awareness has been
      reported to be between 1-2/1000 cases, but recent data suggest that this may be an
      overestimate. The Bispectral Index (BIS) Monitor is an electroencephalographic method of
      assessing depth of anesthesia that has been shown in one study to reduce the incidence of
      awareness during anesthesia in the high-risk population (Myles et al, 2004). In the study of
      Myles et al, the number needed to treat (NNT) in order to prevent one case of awareness in
      the high-risk population was 138, with an associated cost of approximately US$2200. Since
      the NNT and the associated cost of treatment would be much higher in the general population,
      the efficacy of the BIS monitor in preventing awareness in all anesthetized patients needs
      to be clearly established. Furthermore, recent data suggest that the BIS may not be useful
      in the high-risk population. The investigators propose a prospective, randomized, controlled
      trial comparing the BIS monitor to electronic alerts based on non-electroencephalographic
      gauges of anesthetic depth.

      Electronic alerts have been developed and employed at our institution and have been shown to
      increase compliance with both clinical and administrative tasks (O'Reilly et al, 2006;
      Kheterpal et al, 2007). The investigators have developed electronic alerts for the purpose
      of informing the clinician of potentially insufficient anesthesia based on minimum alveolar
      concentration (MAC). The algorithm is as follows:

        -  Every 5 minutes the alerting system checks every active case in our operating rooms. It
           takes approximately 1 second for this scan of all active cases to occur.

        -  Conditions for an &quot;active case&quot; are:

             1. data capture is possible (i.e., not a paper record)

             2. data capture is active (i.e., &quot;patient in room&quot; has been electronically entered
                and end-tidal [Et] CO2 is detected)

             3. case has been identified as a general anesthetic

             4. &quot;anesthesia induction end&quot; has already been documented

             5. request for recovery room bed or transport to an intensive care unit has not been
                documented

             6. surgical dressing completion has not been documented

        -  The alerting system checks the most recent value (within a specified time period) of:

             1. Et Sevoflurane (MAC=2.0)

             2. Et Isoflurane (MAC=1.2)

             3. Et Desflurane (MAC=6)

             4. Et Nitrous Oxide (MAC=105) and compares it to the MAC of each agent. It adds the
                resulting MAC values together for &quot;current total MAC.&quot;

        -  The system then checks for a charted propofol infusion in mcg/kg/min and divides by
           150, assuming that 150 mcg/kg/min is &quot;1.0 MAC&quot; for propofol. The analogous concept of
           MAC for propofol is &quot;Cp50&quot;- the plasma or blood concentrations at which 50% of patients
           do not move in response to a noxious stimulus. Since the investigators do not have the
           technology at our institution to calculate Cp50 or Cp50-awake, the investigators have
           chosen the above propofol dose as an initial value based on clinical experience. The
           resultant MAC equivalent is added to current total MAC.

        -  The system next checks for a dexmedetomidine infusion with a rate of 0.2 mcg/kg/hour or
           greater. If present, it multiplies the current total inhalational MAC by 2, as
           dexmedetomidine can reduce MAC by 50%.

        -  At this point, the &quot;current total MAC&quot; is defined as: Et Sevo /2 + Et Iso /1.2 + Et
           Des/6 + Et Nitrous /105 + propofol rate (in mcg/kg/min)/150. If dexmedetomidine is &gt;0.2
           mcg/kg/hour, inhalational MAC is multiplied by 2.

        -  If this total mac &lt; 0.50, it checks to see if a bolus of propofol, midazolam,
           etomidate, or thiopental has been given in the preceding 10 minutes.

        -  It alerts the clinician signed into the case within 30-60 seconds if total age-adjusted
           MAC &lt; 0.50 AND no bolus has been documented in the last 10 minutes.

      This will be the protocol in the MAC-guided group. In the BIS-guided group an electronic
      alert will be sent if the BIS value is &gt;60. If an alert is triggered, the clinician
      electronically signed into the case receives an alphanumeric page stating &quot;Potentially
      insufficient anesthesia, please check vaporizers and intravenous lines.&quot;

      The investigators are collaborating with Washington University, the University of Chicago,
      and the University of Mannitoba, who will also be testing a MAC-based protocol in comparison
      to the BIS.
