  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, controlled trial will compare the incidence of nosocomial
      infections (composite of primary bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract
      infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections) that occur in
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients bathed with 2% chlorhexidine solution versus patients who
      receive standard bathing (soap and water or non-medicated cloths).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon study enrollment, patients will be randomized to one of two study arms. Patients in
      study arm one will receive standard bathing (soap and water or non-medicated cloth) daily.
      Patients in study arm two will receive a 2% chlorhexidine bath on study day 1 and every 48
      hours and a standard bath (soap and water or non-medicated cloths) on study day 2 and every
      48 hours. Patients will be followed until ICU day 28 or discharged from the surgical ICU.

      Hypothesis: Compared to standard daily bathing, chlorhexidine-based bathing on ICU admission
      and every 48 hours will decrease the incidence of nosocomial infections.
