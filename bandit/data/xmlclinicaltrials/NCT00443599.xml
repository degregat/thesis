  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill children, including children undergoing heart surgery, commonly develop
      elevated blood glucose (also known as &quot;blood sugar&quot;) levels during their illness, which can
      lead to poor health outcomes and an increased risk of death. This study will examine the
      effectiveness of maintaining normal blood glucose levels at decreasing infections and
      improving recovery in young children undergoing heart surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children undergoing heart surgery are under significant bodily stress, which can lead to
      higher than normal or lower than normal blood glucose levels. A synthetic form of insulin, a
      naturally occurring hormone in the body, can be injected into people to normalize blood
      glucose levels. Insulin is most commonly used to treat people with diabetes, but it is also
      used in hospitals to control blood glucose levels in patients. Previous studies of adult
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients have shown that patients whose blood sugar levels are
      maintained at normal levels with the use of insulin contract fewer infections and are
      released more quickly from the ICU than patients who do not maintain normal blood glucose
      levels. This study will use a continuous blood glucose monitoring system to detect changes
      in blood glucose levels. Intravenous insulin infusions will be used to then safely maintain
      normal blood glucose levels. The purpose of this study is to determine if maintaining normal
      blood glucose levels during an ICU stay will help decrease the incidence of infections and
      improve surgical recovery in young children following heart surgery.

      This study will enroll children who are undergoing heart surgery that requires a
      cardiopulmonary bypass procedure. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a control
      group or the treatment group. All participants will receive usual care while in the ICU and
      will undergo continuous glucose monitoring. Participants in the treatment group will receive
      intravenous insulin infusions to keep their blood glucose within the normal range. While in
      the ICU, blood will be collected from all participants once a day for the first 3 days and
      then once a week to monitor glucose levels, hormone levels, and measurements of nutrition
      and immune function. On days 1 and 5 following surgery, participants who are on a ventilator
      will have their breath measured to monitor heart function and energy use. Thirty days and 1
      year following surgery, study researchers will contact the participant's parent or doctor to
      collect information on health status and any new infections at the surgical site. Children
      who enroll in the study will be asked to participate in follow-up neurodevelopmental
      evaluations at 1 and 3 years of age to assess longer term cognitive effects of tight
      glycemic control in the ICU.
