  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators tested the impact of purging the graft contents and mesenteric blood into
      the systemic circulation versus washing out this volume out of the circulation in living
      donor liver transplantation recipients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All donors had right hepatectomy. On the back table, surgeons flushed liver grafts with 4
      Liters of cold Custodiol solution. Patients were randomized into either purge group (Pg)
      (n=40) were graft fluid contents were washed out by the patient's portal vein blood (0.5ml
      per gram graft weight) through incompletely anastomosed hepatic vein, or No purge group
      (NPg) (n=40) where graft fluid contents were washed into the systemic circulation by the
      patient's portal blood. The primary outcome objective was the mean arterial blood pressure 5
      minutes after portal declamping. Secondary objectives included hemodynamic and oxygenation.
