  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether neuromuscular electrostimulation (NMES)
      will decrease ICU-associated weakness. The investigators believe that 60 minutes of daily
      NMES will improve strength and function in those who have had extended ICU stays, as well as
      decrease critical illness myopathy as an etiology of weakness in the critically ill.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of critical illness frequently have significant, debilitating and persistent
      weakness after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). This weakness can persist for
      up to 4 years after ICU discharge. There are few interventions that have been successful in
      reducing or preventing weakness. Neuromuscular electrostimulation (NMES) therapy is
      beneficial in other populations of weak and functionally limited patients, such as those
      with chronic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease and end-stage congestive heart failure. We propose a
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of 60 minutes of NMES versus sham
      therapy, applied to the bilateral lower extremities, to reduce ICU-associated weakness in
      patients with acute respiratory failure. Our specific aims are to determine if NMES therapy
      will: 1) increase strength of the 3 treated lower extremity muscle groups (i.e., pretibial,
      triceps surae, and quadriceps), 2) improve important clinical outcomes (i.e., functional
      status, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, in-hospital
      mortality, and total hospital charges), 3) reduce critical illness myopathy as an etiology
      of weakness in clinically weak ICU patients. We hypothesize that NMES therapy will reduce
      ICU-associated weakness, and improve clinical and functional outcomes. Additionally, the
      rates of critical illness myopathy as an etiology of weakness in clinically weak ICU
      patients will be lower in those receiving NMES versus sham therapy. Since there is no single
      test that is optimal for measuring muscle strength in the critically ill, we will employ
      four non-invasive measures: manual muscle testing (MMT), hand held dynamometry (HHD),
      handgrip dynamometry (HGD), and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). With no existing
      therapeutic options available, our study explores the potential of NMES as a feasible
      intervention to reduce ICU-associated weakness.

Neuromuscular Electrostimulation (NMES) CareStim Muscle Stimulation Device (Care Rehab; McLean, VA): 60 minute NMES sessions will be applied to three muscle groups of the lower extremities (quadriceps, pretibial, and triceps surae). Sessions start at study entry, and will occur every day for the duration of subject's ICU stay.</description>
