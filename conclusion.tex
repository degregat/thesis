\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Natural directions for further generalization beyond our final model are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Settings with more supervision. Prediction markets and learning from expert advice have a tight connection, and as we have seen so do bandits and decisions markets. However, the two connections are quite different. Is it possible to extend feedback graphs and other notions that interpolate between the bandit and full supervision settings to take into account incentivising experts as in our model. 

\item General sources of information that are observed after the action has been chosen by the algorithm. Compliance has a very specific structural relation to , what can be said generically about what structure the ifnroation has to have to be useful

\end{enumerate}
